# Chameleon

API for a game meant to be played locally with friends. It would be better as an
App but I wanted to try deno.

## How to play

There is no reference that I know of about rules of this game, if I ever feel
like it I can write them here

## Setup

Install dependencies with npm \
Run with deno

```bash
  npm --prefix ./svelte install ./svelte
  deno task front-build
  deno task run
```
